There is a hacker on the loose!

She has stolen millions in bitcoin, we need your help to bring her to justice! In the scene of the crime there was only a piece of paper saying "Razz was here".

She uploaded a photo of a plane to one of her social media accounts a few months before the hack.

Your job is to figure out the origin and destination of said flight (using 3 letter airport code), the social media handle she uses (to this day) and her artistic name.
